v0.4.7 fix thrift gem dependency

v0.4.6 Add support for oneway methods.

v0.4.5. Fix broken retries.

v0.4.4. Default to 0 retries rather than the number of servers.

v0.4.3. Bug fixes: handle_exception could be called more than once. Integer types are read signed.

v0.4.2. Allow per-method overrides of retries. Fix several bugs with EventMachine.

v0.4.1. Making ThriftClient decoratable. Able to add new functionality a class definition.

v0.4.0. Add new EventMachine transport.  This requires two layers of transport
configurability:
  options[:transport] for EventMachine or Socket transports
  options[:transport_wrapper] for optional Buffered or Framed Transport.
Clients will need to update their options to ensure they don't conflict with this change. (mperham)
Revert global timeouts. (ryanking)
